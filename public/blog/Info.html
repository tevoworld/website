    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the Blog</h1>
    <p>This is going to be the place where I post random things for everyone to read at their will. This is pure html in a box, not using iframes but rather using javascript to get a list of html files in a directory.</p>

    <p><i>It is a little clunky at the moment</i>, so I will update this page further before I start doing things like weekly posts. I could also run a mastodon bot that makes a post every time I add a new blog page.</p>
  
    <p>There's a little "test post" I threw in to just mess around with, but I will eventually remove it soon.</p>
